# natural-gentoo-remastered
This theme is a sort of remaster of [natural-gentoo](https://jtyr.github.io/natural-gentoo), an old GRUB and Splashutils theme I found on the Internet a while ago that I couldn't install, possibly due to its age, so I decided to remake it.

This repo contains both a GRUB theme and a Plymouth theme to customize the splash screen at the start.

# Installation
It should be noted that this README makes a few assumptions about the system it's going to be installed in. It's assumed that both GRUB and Plymouth are already installed and configured on your machine, and the initrd image is built using dracut (if done manually please refer to the documentation used to do so when performing the final step on "Configuring the system").

## Installing the theme
* For Gentoo, this theme can be installed with the "x11-themes/natural-gentoo-remastered" package available in [my overlay](https://github.com/foopsss/Ebuilds). Both parts of the theme can be installed individually with the "grub" and "plymouth" use flags.

* For other Linux distributions, the theme can be manually installed by copying and pasting the "natural-gentoo-remastered-grub" and/or "natural-gentoo-remastered-plymouth" folders into "/boot/grub/themes" and "/usr/share/plymouth/themes" respectively.

## Configuring the system
After installing the theme, the "grub" file at "/etc/default" has to be modified to add the following line:

	GRUB_THEME="/boot/grub/themes/natural-gentoo-remastered/theme.txt"

Also, natural-gentoo-remastered has to be set as the default Plymouth theme:

	plymouth-set-default-theme natural-gentoo-remastered

Finally, the GRUB configuration and the initrd image have to be rebuilt for the theme to be properly installed and detected by the system. It can be done with:

	grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg && dracut --force

If GRUB detected the theme succesfully it will output "*Found theme: /boot/grub/themes/natural-gentoo-remastered/theme.txt*". Meanwhile, dracut will output something like "*Creating initramfs image file '/boot/initramfs-*.img' done*".

# Caveats
* The background images for the theme are specifically tuned to my display, meaning their resolution is 1366x768. I don't know if there's a way to make the images more usable for other display sizes.
* The GRUB theme uses the standard stock font. This is something I haven't paid much attention to but I'm definitely open to changing it. It does not use scrollbars either because I don't have many boot options, but it's definitely something that can be added if others need it.
